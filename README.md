# Assignment 1 - ReactJS app.

Name: Jessica Browne

## Overview.

the movie app from weeks 3-6 with some different colors and a few extra features and pages, 
reccomendations page dosnt work and as far as i can tell it probally wont in the time left before the deadline, 

all other features and pages work along with a much more "2am coding session" friendly and prevents eye strain



### Features.

+ Upcoming movies
+ Trending movies
+ Recommended Movies (broken ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ )
+ Watchlist page and functionality

## Setup requirements.
start the react server as normal from the movies folder

## API endpoints.

+ gets a list of upcoming movies -  https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/upcoming
+ Gets a list of trending movies-   https://api.themoviedb.org/3/trending/movie/day
+ gives a list of movie reccomendations -   https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{movie_id}/recommendations

## Routing.

+ /movies/upcoming - displays upcoming movies    
+ /movies/trending - displaus trending movies
+ /movies/:id/recommendations - is supposed to show reccomdenations but is broken
+ /movies/watchlist - shows the users watch lists



## Independent learning (If relevant).

this youtube video and part one of it aswell, 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndvLweyoIE4 (i dont have timestamps its 2h 30 mins long and i fell asleep to it)
i couldent get the new pages to work so i watched this guy and i realised i had added an id peramter to the static ones aswell as spelling reccomended wrong in alot of places. but also showed me how to change colors of the different containers.
